# Feltilizer Coupon Registration Mobile App
## Introduction
Malawi as a country relies on agriculture for both its economy and food growth. As such, the government through its small holder famers and big farmers cultivate crops every year for export and domestic use.

Fertilizer is one of the essential materials for every farmer to have large harvest every year. Unfortunately, not every farmer, specifically small holder farmers do afford to get much fertilizers that is required for their fields. Some farmers even fail to get a single bag of fertilizer. As a result, these farmers get less sometimes no yields at all.

The Malawi government has put in an initiative to subsidize fertilizer so that small holder farmers can buy this fertilizer at lower cost. For this process to take effect, government needs to register all small holder farmers so that it should know who is supposed to receive the coupons. Obviously, a manual registration using papers will cost the government a lot than computerizing the whole process. 

## Motivation
The issue of fertilizer is critical in agriculture, and Malawi being an agriculture dependent nation, the government has embarked on a mission to help itd farmers most especially small holder farmers. For that fact, government is gathering information of all small holder farmers through manual registration, where it has sent out more data collectors to go and register farmers. This will help the government to budget well.

Looking at the whole process and how hectic and in accurate the manual registration gets, it has motivated me to develop an App that will enable small farmers to do the registration on their own and their convinient time.

The Malawi government is going to save a huge chunk of money because the registration process will not take a lot of time, also, the government will not employ a lot of people for this process.

## How It Would Work
The main features for the app include: REGISTER | _LEMBETSANI_, for self-registering of farmersâ€™ information into the system, UPDATE | _LOWETSANI_, for updating information, DELETE INFO |_FUFUTANI_, for deletion of information, VIEW INFO | _ONANI_, for viewing of the information from the system.
