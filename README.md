# Workout Rest Mobile App
## Introduction
This is a mobile app designed to serve sports men and women, most especially those that workout in the gym. The sole purpose for this application is do a count down during resting specifically, so that people can know the right time to resume to the next work out. Not to over rest and also to under rest.

## Motivation
Each time I am in the gym working out, time for resting in between the sets is always compromised. This results in also compromising the exercise itself. Instead of concentrating much on the workout so that we get maximum results out of it, we end up doing too much rest which defeats the whole purpose of the workout.

## How It Would Work
When users opens up the app, they would see a few buttons which will be start and stop. Also, there will be an option to set time one would want to rest. Knowing pretty well that one can only rest within one minute, the app will only accept rest within that single minute.

To start, the user can simply tap in the middle of the app or the actual start button which will be placed at a corner. But before that, the user would have already set the time for resting. Now, the app will start the count down according to the set time, then the user resumes to the next set. Better still, the user can decide to stop the count down by tapping on the stop button, then move to the next set.
